      <h3><i>Our Pedigree</i></h3>
      <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/505734805028208640/68mKLojd.png"></p>

      <h4><i>Benjamin Southworth</i></h4>
    <p>
      "Ben Southworth is one of the leading voices on the London and UK tech scene. As a founding member of 3Beards, the group behind Silicon Drinkabout, Digital Sizzle and the Don’t Pitch Me Bro events, Ben has undoubtedly been a major player in helping to bring London’s tech community closer together." ~ Virgin Media Business. 
    </p>
    <p> Benjamin Southworth left school at aged 18 with no A-Levels and no future, and in 2012 walked in the front door of Number 10 Downing Street as Deputy Chief Executive of Tech City Investment Organisation ( Now TechCityUK ). His story is as wonderfully unique as he is. An auto-didact across music, art, programming, and co-founder of several well regarded intiatives (<a href="http://3-beards.com">3beards,<a href="http://unicornhunt.io">Unicorn Hunt</a>, <a href="http://www.techbikers.com">TechBikers</a> alongside a wealth of board seats, trustee positions, side projects and artistic pursuits. He's interviewed at yCombinator, been Entrepenuer In Residence for TechStars London, Software Evangelist for The European Union, featured in every major Broadsheet, even attempting to found a school for digital Entrepeneurship (Now superseeded by the fantastic <a href="http://www.adacollege.org.uk">ADA: National College of Digital Skills</a> (He donated the name)). He's done a lot, and he's not yet 35. But he wouldn't tell you any of this. He'd rather talk about ideas and how we can change world, together.</p>

       <h3><i>Our Clients</i></h3>
      We only work with ideas that will tear the market asunder. We can't always say much about them, but they ain't your run of mill, "me too" apps pretending to businesses.

     Yoti is an identity app that puts you, the user in control of your identity. We're switching the game around, we're turning the tables, and we're giving power back to the people. <a href="http://www.yoti.com">www.yoti.com</a> </p>

      <p> Many of our clients aren't launched yet, and as such we use readacted as a way to keep them safe &amp; secure. All we can say is, you've never seen banking like this before. </p>

       <h3><i>Our Philsophy</i></h3>
      <p> The internet changed eveything, and keeps on doing so. We all knew computers were amazing, but now, everyone has a supercomputer in their pocket,  a broadband connection in their pants and constant non-stop connection to the people, places and objects they love.</p>
      <p> This gives new businesses an incredible opportuntiy, either to crush the incumbants, or to create businesses with heart, soul and passion like never before. </p>
      <p> We want to help you be a part of this change, we want to help you find new customers, new employees, new opportunites, new markets and new ways of thinking about the world. </p>
      <p> We have crazy ideas full of half-baked philosphies, but we don't care, we know we're not right 100% of the time, no-one is. This is a brave new future, and we're all trying to figure it out.</p>
      <p> With creative thinking, technology taking the strain and good, old fasioned human ingenuity we build businesses our customers, our employess, and our shareholders will love. </p>
      <p> Of course, if you don't want that, then there's a bunch of other peopel who will happily take your money and tell you how they've not got enough resource. </p>
